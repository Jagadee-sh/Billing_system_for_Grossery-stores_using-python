# Billing_system_for_Grossery-stores_using-python

## Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface: The graphical user interface (GUI) makes it easy for users to navigate and input data effortlessly.

Customer Details: Customers can enter their name and phone number for record-keeping purposes.

Itemized Billing: The system allows users to specify the quantity of each grocery item purchased, enabling accurate billing.

Automatic Calculation: Total prices for food, grocery, and other items, along with their respective taxes, are calculated automatically, streamlining the billing process.

Detailed Bill Generation: The application generates a detailed bill listing all purchased items, quantities, prices, and the total amount payable.

Clearing and Exiting: Users have the option to clear the bill area to start afresh or exit the application once the transaction is complete


 ## Required Modules:
The code uses Tkinter, which is a standard Python library for creating GUI applications. Usually, Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python, so you shouldn’t need to install anything extra if you’re using a standard Python installation.

However, if you’re using a version of Python where Tkinter is not included by default or if you encounter any issues, you may need to install Tkinter separately. Here’s how you can install Tkinter depending on your operating system:

For Windows:

Tkinter is typically included with the standard Python installation on Windows. If you’re using Python from the official Python website (python.org), Tkinter should already be available.

For macOS:

Tkinter is usually included with Python on macOS. You can install Python from the official Python website if you haven’t already done so.

For Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

You can install Tkinter using the package manager. Open a terminal and run:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
Replace python3-tk with python-tk if you’re using Python 2.


## Code Explanation:

This code creates a simple Grocery Billing System using Tkinter, a Python GUI library. Let’s break down the code:

Import Statements: The code starts by importing necessary modules – tkinter for GUI and random for generating random bill numbers.

Class Definition: The Bill_App class is defined, which serves as the main application class.

Initialization: In the __init__ method of the class, the GUI window is configured with a specific size, title, and components.

Variable Initialization: Several StringVar and IntVar variables are initialized to hold customer details and the quantity of various items purchased.

GUI Layout:

The layout is organized using Label, Entry, and LabelFrame widgets to represent different sections such as customer details, food items, grocery items, others, bill area, and buttons.
Each section contains labels and entry fields to input data.
Functions:

total: Calculates the total prices for food, grocery, and other items, along with their respective taxes.
welcome_soft: Updates the text area with customer details and a header for the bill list.
clear: Clears the bill area.
bill_area: Adds product names, quantities, and prices to the bill area.
exit: Closes the application window.
Main Execution:

It creates an instance of the Tk class to create the application window.
An object of the Bill_App class is created, passing the Tk instance.
The mainloop() method is called to start the GUI event loop.
